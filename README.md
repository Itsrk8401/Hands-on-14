# Hands-on-14

# Kruskal's Algorithm:
- *Advantages*: Greedy, optimal MST solution, efficient for sparse graphs.
- *Disadvantages*: Inefficient for dense graphs, sorting complexity, requires extra space.

# Depth-First Search (DFS):
- *Advantages*: Simple, space-efficient, useful for topological ordering.
- *Disadvantages*: May not find solution with cycles, non-optimal for shortest paths, time complexity.

# Topological Sort:
- *Advantages*: Provides deterministic ordering, useful for dependency resolution, efficient.
- *Disadvantages*: Only applicable to DAGs, non-unique solutions, doesn't handle cyclic dependencies well.
